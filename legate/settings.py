        How many possibly-exception-throwing tasks to emit before blocking.
        Legate by default does not wait for operations to complete, but instead
        "runs ahead" and continues launching work, which will complete
        asynchronously. If an operation throws an exception, then by the time
        an exception is reported execution may have progressed beyond the
        launch of the faulting operation. If you need to check for an exception
        at the exact point where it might get thrown (e.g. to catch it and
        recover gracefully), set this to 1. Note that this will introduce more
        blocking in the control logic of your program, likely reducing overall
        utilization.
