    Construct a single-column Table backed by a collection of buffers
    distributed across the machine.

    Each buffer is assumed to cover a disjoint dense subset of a rectangular
    n-dimensional domain, and is identified by its "color", an m-dimensional
    integer point.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtype : Dtype
        Type of the data to ingest

    shape : int | Tuple[int]
        N-dimensional dense rectangular domain of the data to ingest

    colors : int | Tuple[int]
        M-dimensional dense rectangle indexing all the buffers to ingest

    data_split : DataSplit
        Specifies what subset of the overall domain is covered by each buffer

    get_buffer : Callable[[Point], memoryview]
        This function will be called on the appropriate process for each color
        (see the documentation for `get_local_colors`) and should return a
        pre-existing buffer residing in local memory, or generate one on the
        fly, e.g. by reading from a file.

        The contents of each buffer may be in row-major or column-major order.
        Legate will take ownership of the returned memory.

    get_local_colors : Callable[[], Iterable[Point]] | None
        If `None` then Legate will assume that every buffer is accessible from
        any process (rank) where Legate is running. Legate will then invoke
        `get_buffer` once for each color, with each invocation happening on an
        unspecified process and host, wherever Legate decides it wants that
        subset of the domain to reside.

        This mode is appropriate e.g. if each buffer is created on the fly by
        loading from a file, and every file is available on all hosts over a
        distributed filesystem.

        If not `None`, then Legate will assume that each buffer is only
        available on a single process. It will invoke `get_local_colors` once
        on each process, and will only inquire about the returned colors on
        that process. Each color in `colors` should be returned from exactly
        one invocation of `get_local_colors`.

        If you are launching Legate by specifiying a `--launcher` flag to the
        Legate driver, then by default every Legate process corresponds to a
        different host, and you can use the hostname to decide which buffers
        every call to `get_buffer` should return. If you are performing a
        custom launch then it is possible that multiple Legate processes are
        running on the same host, in which case the hostname will not be
        sufficient, and you will need to consult other information, e.g. the
        process ID or a launcher-set environment variable such as
        `OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK`.

        This mode is appropriate e.g. if you want to ingest the pre-distributed
        output of a preceding non-Legate computation, or if the data is loaded
        from a collection of files, each of which is only available on a single
        host. Because you are essentially dictating the placement of data under
        this mode, it is more likely that Legate will need to reshuffle the
        data to meet the needs of a subsequent operation.
